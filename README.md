# Pair-Me-FrontEnd

This is the front-end! Adam and I will be working on this section!

**Problem**
PMs don't have an easy way to monitor which students need help without sifting through Slack comments. 

Students don't have a straightforward way to match with people to pair-program with on projects.

**Solution**
PairMe provides a visual dashboard that makes it easier for Lambda students to find help, and for PMs/Students to offer help. PairMe can also reduce Zoom redundancy by showing active meetings, and their topics of discussion, so that students looking for help can easily jump on an active Zoom if it's relevant to their problems.
